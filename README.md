Front-end project of a social network developed with React, Typescript, Styled-components, Axios.

In this project (IN PROGRESS) the interface of an application of a social network is being developed, which contains a user feed page, profile pages, groups, photos, events, forum and other functionalities that make up a social network.

This project was taken as a UX base and inspired by the Olympkus template, which is one of several wordpress templates on the Themeforest website.

Initially this project was a big challenge, as it was started without typescript and later the typescript was added to the project, having to refactor some of the components.

I use the Context API for state management. And a Fake API was also created in a json file (db.json), which returns data from users and groups, and this data is consumed with Axios.

Some pages are still under development, and soon the project will be 100% finalized, and all implementations of features and new features will be in production.
